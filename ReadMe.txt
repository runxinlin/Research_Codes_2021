####Regression Section####

####CAPM Simulation#### 
compare the bias of OLS, IV

####OLS Regression####
-CAPM
-FF3-Factor ***Adding firm characteristics as control variables
-Carhart4-Factor 
-FF5-Factor ***Adding firm characteristics as control variables

####IV Regression####
-CAPM
-FF3 ***Adding firm characteristics as control variables
-Carhart4-Factor
-FF5 ***Adding firm characteristics as control variables

####IC/ICIR####
Calculate IC/ICIR for FF5-Factor and their corresponding firm characteries

#### Compare CS and TS Factor Model
TS Factor Model I (Rf + FF5) # constant factor loadings
CS Factor Model I (Rz + CS_FF4) # time-varying factor loadings
CS Factor Model II (Rf + CS_FF5) # constant factor loadings
